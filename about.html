            <p>Hello my name is garrett Washington and I'm a computer technology major at Wayne 
                State. I am specializing in creative coding and system design. In my free tinme I 
                develop my skills in blender and other libraries that take use of 3d software. Outside 
                of anything technical I like to go swimming and spend my time in nature.
